# Analysis------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Configure the maximum length of analysis printed out by lz-analyze and other places.
# Controls the number of moves after the first move in a variation.
# analysisPVLen = 15

# Report winrates for chat and analysis as (BLACK|WHITE|SIDETOMOVE).
# Default is SIDETOMOVE, which is what tools that use LZ probably also expect
# reportAnalysisWinratesAs = SIDETOMOVE

# Uncomment and and set to a positive value to make KataGo explore the top move(s) less deeply and accurately,
# but explore and give evaluations to a greater variety of moves, for analysis (does NOT affect play).
# A value like 0.03 or 0.06 will give various mildly but still noticeably wider searches.
# An extreme value like 1 will distribute many playouts across every move on the board, even very bad moves.

# Default rules------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# See https://lightvector.github.io/KataGo/rules.html for a description of the rules.
# These rules are defaults and can be changed mid-run by several custom GTP commands.
# See https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo/blob/master/docs/GTP_Extensions.md for those commands.

scoringRule = AREA  # options: AREA, TERRITORY

# Bot behavior---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Resignation -------------

# Resignation occurs if for at least resignConsecTurns in a row,
# the winLossUtility (which is on a [-1,1] scale) is below resignThreshold.
allowResignation = true
resignThreshold = -0.90
resignConsecTurns = 3
# Uncomment to make katago not resign close games, behind by fewer than this many points
# resignMinScoreDifference = 10

# Handicap -------------

# Assume that if black makes many moves in a row right at the start of the game, then the game is a handicap game.
# This is necessary on some servers and for some GUIs and also when initializing from many SGF files, which may
# set up a handicap games using repeated GTP "play" commands for black rather than GTP "place_free_handicap" commands.
# However, it may also lead to incorrect understanding of komi if whiteHandicapBonus is used and a server does NOT
# have such a practice.
# Defaults to true! Uncomment and set to false to disable this behavior.
# assumeMultipleStartingBlackMovesAreHandicap = true

# Makes katago dynamically adjust in handicap or altered-komi games to assume it is stronger or weaker than the opponent
# based on those game settings making sense, greatly improving handicap strength but biasing winrates and scores.
# Does NOT affect analysis (lz-analyze, kata-analyze, used by programs like Lizzie) so analysis remains unbiased.
# Uncomment and set this to 0 to disable this and make KataGo play the same always.
# dynamicPlayoutDoublingAdvantageCapPerOppLead = 0.045

# Instead of a dynamic level, you can uncomment this and set this to a value from -3.0 to 3.0 to set KataGo's aggression to a FIXED level.
# DOES affect analysis (lz-analyze, kata-analyze, used by programs like Lizzie).
# Negative makes KataGo behave as if it is much weaker than the opponent, preferring to play defensively.
# Positive makes KataGo behave as if it is much stronger than the opponent, prefering to play aggressively or even overplay slightly.
# If this and "dynamicPlayoutDoublingAdvantageCapPerOppLead" are BOTH set then dynamic will be used for all games and this fixed
# value will be used for analysis tools.
# playoutDoublingAdvantage = 0.0

# Uncommenting one of these will enforce that the FIXED playoutDoublingAdvantage will only apply when KataGo plays the specified color
# and will be negated when playing the opposite color.

# playoutDoublingAdvantagePla = WHITE

# Misc Behavior --------------------

# Uncomment and set to true to make KataGo avoid a particular joseki that some KataGo nets misevaluate,
# and also to improve opening diversity versus some particular other bots that like to play it all the time.
# avoidMYTDaggerHack = false

# Search limits-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# For all of "maxVisits", "maxPlayouts", "maxTime", search will still try to follow GTP time controls and may make a move
# faster than the specified max if GTP tells it that it is playing under a clock as well in the current game.

# If provided, limit maximum number of root visits per search to this much. (With tree reuse, visits do count earlier search)
# maxVisits = 500
# If provided, limit maximum number of new playouts per search to this much. (With tree reuse, playouts do not count earlier search)
# maxPlayouts = 300
# If provided, cap search time at this many seconds.
# maxTime = 10

# Ponder on the opponent's turn?

# GPU Settings-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Maximum number of positions to send to a single GPU at once.
# The default value here is roughly equal to numSearchThreads, but you can specify it manually
# if you are running out of memory, or if you are using multiple GPUs that expect to split
# up the work.
